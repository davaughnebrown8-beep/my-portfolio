                <h3>My Favorite AI Business Idea</h3>
                <p>
                    Based on the "AI Businesses of 2025" blog post, my favorite idea is the <strong>Personalized fitness and nutrition plans</strong>. This concept uses Artificial Intelligence modify and customize health, fitness, and diet plans for individuals, based on their lifestyle.
                </p>
                <h4>Application</h4>
                <p>
                    This AI could be applied in my world as a mobile application or other portable device that syncs with your personal life creating a better and healthier lifestyle. It could provide real-time insights into nutrition such as to track what you eat, how much calories to burn or even creating a meal plan for your fitness goals, create workout schedules that strikes a balance with your real life activities, and offer suggestions on how to save money for specific goals, and track how sleep your getting.
                </p>
                <h4>Ethical Issues & Solutions</h4>
                <p>
                    A major ethical issue is data privacy. Users' health data is very confidential and sensitive. A solution would be to use strong encryption, anonymize data whenever possible, and provide clear, transparent privacy policies. Users should have full control over their data and the ability to delete it at any time.
                </p>
                <h4>Example App</h4>
                <p>
                    An example of a similar app is <strong>Lumen</strong>. Lumen is a AI-powered nutrition and metabolism tracking, it provides Daily nutrition guidance, Real-time metabolic feedback and Syncs with fitness trackers.

                    <h3>Chapter 4 Summary</h3>
                    <p>
<h4>Achieve Your Goals</h4>
<p>Summary:
In this chapter, Charlie explains to Michael that goals give direction and purpose to life. Successful people know exactly what they want and create a plan to reach it. Writing goals down, setting deadlines, and taking consistent steps are essential. Without goals, people tend to drift without achieving much.
</p>
<p>Reflection:
This reminds me that I need to be more intentional about what I want to achieve. Setting clear goals for my studies and future career can help me stay focused. For example, I can set a goal to improve my programming skills by completing specific projects or courses. Having written goals will motivate me to stay disciplined and measure my progress over time.</p.

                    <h3>Chapter 5 Summary</h3>
                    <p>
<h4>The Proper Use of Time</h4>
<p>Summary:
Charlie teaches that time is life’s most valuable asset. Everyone has the same 24 hours, but how we use it determines our success. Wasting time on unimportant things prevents us from growing. To succeed, we must prioritize important tasks that move us closer to our goals.</p>

<p>Reflection:
This chapter made me realize how much time I sometimes waste on distractions like social media. I can apply this by planning my days better and focusing on tasks that matter most. By managing my time wisely, I’ll be more productive, less stressed, and more likely to reach my personal and academic goals.</p>

                    <h3>Chapter 6 Summary</h3>
                    <p>
<h4>Surround Yourself with the Best People</h4>
<p>Summary:
Charlie explains that the people we associate with have a strong influence on our thoughts, habits, and success. If we spend time with positive and ambitious people, we’re more likely to develop those same qualities. On the other hand, negative people can hold us back.</p>

<p.Reflection:
This is something I can relate to. I’ve noticed that being around motivated people helps me stay focused and inspired. I plan to build relationships with people who share my values and goals so that we can encourage each other. The right company can push me to grow and become a better version of myself.

                    <h3>Chapter 7 Summary</h3>
                    <p>
<h4>Be a Life-Long Learner</h4>
<p>Summary:
In this chapter, Charlie teaches that learning should never stop after school. Successful people are always growing — reading books, seeking advice, and learning from experiences. Knowledge is the key to continuous improvement and success.
</p>
<p>Reflection:
I can apply this by committing to keep learning new things, even outside the classroom. Whether it’s reading more, watching educational videos, or practicing coding, every bit of learning helps me grow. By becoming a life-long learner, I can stay adaptable and better prepared for future opportunities.
